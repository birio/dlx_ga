  \section{Design Overview}
  \label{sec:design_overview}
  The $\mu$DLX (said micro-DeLuX) is a 32-bit simple RISC-type architecture. It features a minimal instruction set, relatively few addressing modes, and a processor organization designed to simplify implementation. The microprocessor hardware structure has a five-deep pipeline architecture, and was highly designed to cover low complexity applications. The $\mu$DLX is a 32-bit word-oriented system. Its architecture is composed by 16 GPR (General Purpose Registers) in one register file. Two of these registers are reserved for special purposes. Register 0 always contains zero. It can be used as a source operand whenever zero is needed, and stores to it have no effect. Register 16 is reserved for use by some $\mu$DLX instructions, as will be described shortly. $\mu$DLX also has a 32 bit program counter.
  
  $\mu$DLX current state supports basic arithmetical and logical operations, including multiplication and division. Those operations and others are fully detailed in the following sections. 
  
 \subsection{Perspectives}
    
  The $\mu$DLX 32-bit core release targets FPGA devices and is intended to be deployed as a GPPU soft IP-core. It was designed under DLX original architecture proposed by Hennessy \& Patterson (1996) which is highly based in further MIPS architecture. The $\mu$DLX presents a slightly reduced ISA.
  
  \subsection{Main Characteristics}
  $\mu$DLX is a 32-bit soft core processor that has been designed for general embedded applications. The main $\mu$DLX features are highlighted below.
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Support for 32-bit word;
   \item 32-bit RAM address;
   \item Parallel memory interface modules for data (2 SDRAM 32Mx16) and instructions (1 SRAM 2Mx16);
   \item 16 general purpose registers;
   \item RISC-Like Architecture with a five-deep pipeline;
   \item Load-Store/Register-Register processor architecture;
   \item $\mu$DLX Instruction Set Architecture (See Section \color{black}{\ref{sec:isa}});
   \item Hardware division and multiplication implementation;
   \item Three instructions functional groups: (1) load and store; (2) computational; and (3) jump and branch.
   \item Three addressing modes: (1) immediate; (2) base-shift; and (3) by register;
   \item Capability of handle three successive data hazards (RAW) without \texttt{NOP} insertion between functional pipeline stages;
  \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Non-functional Requirements}
  Among the $\mu$DLX main characteristics, a list of non-functional requirements is given by the following:
  
  \begin{itemize}
   \item The FPGA prototype should run in a Terasic ALTERA DE2-115 platform;
   \item The design must be described using Verilog-HDL;
   \item A set of core processor \textit{testbenches} must have be provided 
  \end{itemize}

  
  \newpage
  \section{Instruction Set Architecture}
  \label{sec:isa}
  $\mu$DLX is built under the perspective of RISC Load-Store/Register-Register processor architecture. CPU instructions are 32-bits long word and organized into the following functional groups:
  
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Load and store
   \item Computational
   \item Jump and branch
  \end{itemize}
  
  \subsection{CPU Load and Store Instructions}
  
  $\mu$DLX-based processors use a load/store architecture; all operations are performed on operands held in processor registers and main memory is accessed only through load and store instructions.
  
  Signed and unsigned integers of different sizes are supported by loads that either sign-extend or zero-extend the data loaded into the register. Table \ref{tab:load_store_instructions} lists aligned CPU load and store instructions.

  \begin{table}[H]

	LW   & Load word from data memory.	\\ \hline
	SW   & Store word in memory. 		\\ \hline
      \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
  \end{table}  
  
  
  \subsection{Computational Instructions}
  
  The computational instructions uses ALU two-operand instructions. Two's complement arithmetic is performed on integers represented in two's complement notation. These are signed versions of the following operations:

  \begin{itemize}
   \item Add
   \item Subtract
   \item Multiply
   \item Divide
  \end{itemize}

  The $\mu$DLX provides 32-bit integers and 32-bit arithmetic. Table \ref{tab:alu} lists those arithmetic and logical instructions computations.

	  RET  	& -- 		& Unconditional & Subroutine return 			\\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
      \end{center}
    \end{table} 
  
  \subsection{No Operation Instruction}
  The \textit{No Operation} instruction (\texttt{NOP}) is used to control the instruction flow or to insert delays (stalls) into the datapath such as when computing the result of a jump/branch instruction. When using a NOP instruction after a branch/jump instruction it is so named a \textbf{branch delay slot}.
  
  \subsection{End of Opperations}
  The HALT instruction (system stop) must be implemented as a \texttt{L: j L} (a unconditional branch to the current address)
   
  \section{Pipeline Architecture}
  \label{sec:pipeline}
  A block diagram of the $\mu$DLX pipeline architecture is shown in Figure \ref{fig:pipeline}. The architecture components are organized by a five-deep pipeline architecture. This pipeline architecture implements a Forwarding Unit in order to avoid RAW data hazards. The transfer control hazards is solved by the insertion of a Branch Prediction unit within the first pipeline stage.

    \caption{Pipeline datapath structure proposal.}
  \label{fig:datapath}
  \end{figure}
  
  The $\mu$DLX core processor uses a five-deep parallel pipeline on its architecture. The current pipeline is divided into the following stages, also described in Figure \ref{fig:pipeline}:
  
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item Instruction Fetch
   \item Instruction Decode
   \item Arithmetic operation (Execution)
   \item Memory access
   \item Write back
  \end{enumerate}

   \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{pictures/pipeline_ex.eps}
   \caption{Five-Deep Single-Completion Pipeline.}
   \label{fig:pipeline}
  \end{figure}
  
  \section{Internal General Purpose Registers}
  \label{sec:register}
  The current $\mu$DLX architecture provides 16 fixed-point general purpose registers: $R_0$ to $R_{15}$. Two of these register have special use for the hardware. One $R_0$ always returns zero, no matter what software attempts to store to it. The other ($R_{15}$) is used by the normal subroutine-calling instruction (Jump and Link) for the return address.
